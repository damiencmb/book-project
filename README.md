# Book project

For this project, I wanted to focus on books, because it's a universal subject, since most literate people have read at least one book at some point in their lives. So, in this sea of offerings, it can sometimes be hard to find one's way around and know which book to choose.

That's why I decided to create a book recommender. It's based on different features of the books, such as their genre, ratings, number of pages, price, whether they've won an award or not, and so on.

To carry out my project, I used a dataset from the website https://www.goodreads.com/, consisting of over 52,000 records.
After cleaning up the data, I ended up with a dataset of 34361 records.

After this, I used the KMeans method to create 8 clusters that enabled me to create a recommender where the user enters the title of a book and then sees the 50 best-rated books that they might also like to read.
